   <h3><em>Value understanding; avoid magic</em></h3>
    <p> To the extent that I have an overarching mantra to define my professional life, I think the above would be it. </p>
    
    <p>It means that I value processes with clear and correct principles of operation over all else: clarity leads to understanding, and understanding to innovation. This mantra guides my work as a consultant, as a teacher, and as a data scientist.</p>

    <p>Welcome to my website; feel free to look around!</p>
