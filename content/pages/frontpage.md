    <h3>Professional</h3>
    <p>
    I am the co-founder of <a href="https://win-vector.com/">Win-Vector, LLC</a>, a data science consulting and training firm based in San Francisco.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    I am also the VP of Data Science Practice for <a href="https://www.wallaroo.ai">Wallaroo.AI</a>, whose mission is to make production ML more data-scientist friendly.
    </p>

    <p>
    With John Mount, I co-authored  <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/practical-data-science-with-r-second-edition"><em>Practical Data Science with R</em></a>, which is now in its second edition.
    </p>

    <p>
    To the extent that I have an overarching mantra to define my professional life, I think it would be <em>Value understanding; avoid magic</em>. That means I value clear and correct principles of operation over everything: more than speed, or technical sexiness, or almost anything else that might obfuscate the process. This mantra guides my work as a consultant, as a teacher, and as a data scientist.

    <h3>Personal</h3>

    <p>
    When I'm not working, I write, translate (mostly from Spanish, other times from Filipino), and indulge in what I call "literary sleuthing." I record my progress on these various projects in my <a href="/pages/personal-writing/">many personal blogs</a>. I also maintain a microblog called <a href="https://ninazumel.com/short_thoughts"><em>Short Thoughts</em></a>, to announce new developments, or sometimes post, well, a short thought.
    </p>

    <p>
    I <a href="https://www.dholrhythms.com/">dance</a> and choreograph, too.
