    <p> When I'm not working, I read, write, translate (mostly from Spanish, other times from Filipino), and indulge in what I call "literary sleuthing." I record my progress on these various projects in my many personal blogs. 

   <p>I <a href="https://www.dholrhythms.com"/">dance</a> and choreograph, too.</p>

<h2>My Blogs</h2>

<p><strong><a href="http://multoghost.wordpress.com/">Multo (Ghost)</a></strong>: a blog on things ghostly: reviews of supernatural and weird fiction, essays about folklore and history, and random musings.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://exiw.wordpress.com">Ephemera</a></strong>:  a playground for my forays into translation, fiction, personal essay, or any writing that won’t fit my other blogs. </p>

[**Dark Tales Sleuth**](https://darktalessleuth.wordpress.com/): a blog where I document my efforts to track down author and translator attributions for some uncredited supernatural works.

<h2>Special Stuff</h2>

[**Some Ongoing Translation Series**](https://exiw.wordpress.com/translations/): When I have time, I like to find public domain, Spanish language short stories of the supernatural and macabre, and practice translating them.

<p>Folklore articles I’ve written for the <a href="http://folklorethursday.com/author/nina/"><strong>#FolkloreThursday</strong></a> blog.  </p>

<p><a href="https://exiw.wordpress.com/tag/punjab/"><strong>Some articles originally written for the Non Stop Bhangra and Dholrhythms blogs</strong></a>: pieces about Punjabi music, culture and folklore, especially as they relate to Dholrhythms Dance Company and San Francisco's Non Stop Bhangra dance party. </p>
