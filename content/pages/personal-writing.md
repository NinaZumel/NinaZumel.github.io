# Personal Writing

<p><strong><a href="http://multoghost.wordpress.com/">Multo (Ghost)</a></strong>: a blog on things ghostly: reviews of supernatural and weird fiction, essays about folklore and history, and random musings.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://exiw.wordpress.com">Ephemera</a></strong>:  a playground for my forays into translation, fiction, personal essay, or any writing that won’t fit my other blogs. </p>

[**Dark Tales Sleuth**](https://darktalessleuth.wordpress.com/): a blog where I document my efforts to track down author and translator attributions for some uncredited supernatural works.

 Follow [@MultoGhost](https://micro.blog/MultoGhost) at Micro.blog to see a feed where I announce my latest blog posts across all my blogs.
 
 Alternately, subscribe to my microblogging site [Short Thoughts](https://ninazumel.com/short_thoughts/) via RSS.

[**Some Ongoing Translation Series**](https://exiw.wordpress.com/translations/): When I have time, I like to find public domain, Spanish language short stories of the supernatural and macabre, and practice translating them.

<p>Folklore articles I’ve written for the <a href="http://folklorethursday.com/author/nina/"><strong>#FolkloreThursday</strong></a> blog.  </p>

<p><a href="https://exiw.wordpress.com/tag/punjab/"><strong>Some articles originally written for the Non Stop Bhangra and Dholrhythms blogs</strong></a>: pieces about Punjabi music, culture and folklore, especially as they relate to Dholrhythms Dance Company and San Francisco's Non Stop Bhangra dance party. </p>
