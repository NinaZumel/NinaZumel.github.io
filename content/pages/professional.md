   <h3><em>Value understanding; avoid magic</em></h3>
    <p> To the extent that I have an overarching mantra to define my professional life, I think the above would be it. 
    
    It means that I value clear and correct principles of operation over everything: more than speed, or technical sexiness, or almost anything else that might obfuscate the process. This mantra guides my work as a consultant, as a teacher, and as a data scientist.</p>
