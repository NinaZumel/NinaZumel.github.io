I was thinking about the [Four Weights
problem](/blog/2024-09-29-four-weights/) again
recently. You might recall that puzzle poses the question: what are the four
weights that can weigh any object $x$ in the (integer) range 1 to 40 on
a balance scale?

The puzzle just asks you to find the values of the weights, which are
$(1, 3, 9, 27)$. But *how* do you weigh $x$—that is, with (an unknown)
$x$ in the right-hand pan of the scale, how do you determine the
distribution of weights so that the scale balances?

I’m sure if I were the merchant who had to do this every day, I’d
quickly get an approximate feel for the weight of any $x$ I handled, and
could balance the scale quickly and instinctively. But to write down the
procedure in the abstract—it’s probably essentially something like
binary search—isn’t pretty. And what’s the point of recreational math,
if it isn’t pretty?

So I reduced to a simpler problem: **_If I know the value of $x$, how do I
balance the scale?_**

This isn’t a practical question, since if I know $x$, then I don’t have
to weigh the object. But it is kinda pretty. It also brings up a cute
little observation about modular arithmetic, and so it felt worth a
short writeup. The solution is based on a standard procedure for
converting decimal values to a base-$n$ representation. If you are
familiar with that procedure, you can skim the next section and/or skip
to [here](/blog/back_to_4wts/#converting-to-signed-trinary). Otherwise, read on.

## Converting $x$ to a base-n representation

Assume you want to represent a nonnegative integer with up to $m$ digits
in binary. Recall that $m$ binary digits can represent any number in the
range $0 : (2^m - 1)$. This is the pseudo-code.

```text
i = 0        # assume indexing starts at 0
r = zeros(m) # all-zeros vector of length m
if x >= 2^m then throw("x is out of range")

while x > 0
  d = floor(x/2)
  r[i] = x mod 2
  x = d
  i = i+1
  
return reverse(r)  # so lowest value digit is rightmost
```

Let’s do it by hand for $x = 13$, using 4 digits (which can represent up
to the value $2^4 - 1 =  15$).

```
13/2 = 6 rem 1 (d = 6, r = 1)
6/2 = 3 rem 0
3/2 = 1 rem 1
1/2 = 0 rem 1
```

So we have 13 = 1101 in base-2, or `(1*8) + (1*4) + (0*2) + (1*1)`.

For an unsigned trinary representation, the idea is the same, only you
divide by 3 instead of 2. Let’s try it with 18, using 4 digits (which
can represent up to the value $3^4 - 1=80$).

```
18/3 = 6 rem 0
6/3 = 2 rem 0
2/3 = 0 rem 2
```

So 18 = 0200 in base-3, or `(0*27) + (2*9) + (0*3) + (0*1)`.

We can write a general function to convert a decimal number `x` to
base-n representation. I’ll do it in R, just because I’ve been doing all
my puzzles in R.

``` r
# convert x to its unsigned base-n representation
# n: the base
# ndigits: the maximum number of digits
base_n = function(x, n, ndigits) {
  r = numeric(ndigits)
  if(x >= n^ndigits) stop("x is out of range")
  i = 1
  while(x > 0) {
    d = floor(x/n)
    r[i] = x %% n
    x = d
    i = i+1
  }
  
  rev(r)
}

# convert from unsigned base-n back to decimal
to_decimal = function(r, n) {
  r = rev(r) # put the lowest digit to the leftmost
  ndigits = length(r) 
  x = 0
  for(i in 1:ndigits)
    x = x + r[i] * n^(i-1)
    
  x
}
```

``` r
# convert 13 to binary
r = base_n(13, 2, 4)
# confirm this is 13
stopifnot(to_decimal(r, 2)==13)
r
```

    ## [1] 1 1 0 1

``` r
# convert 18 to trinary
r = base_n(18, 3, 4)
# confirm this is 18
stopifnot(to_decimal(r, 3)==18)
r
```

    ## [1] 0 2 0 0

## Converting $x$ to signed trinary

Recall that when solving the Four Weights problem, we established that
any nonnegative integer value $x$ in the range 1:40 could be represented
as

$$
s_1 w_1 + s_2 w_2 + s_3 w_3 + s_4 w_4 = x.
$$

where the weights $w_i$ are `(1, 3, 9, 27)`—we write it smallest-first,
consistently with the previous post on this problem—and
$s_i \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$, rather than the $\{0, 1, 2\}$ of unsigned
trinary. A positive coefficient means the weight goes in the left pan, a
negative coefficient means the weight goes in the right pan with $x$,
and 0 means the weight isn’t used.

The four digits still represent $3^4 = 81$ unique values, but some of
them are now negative. For the Four Weights problem, we are only
concerned with nonnegative $x$, of which we can represent 0, plus
$(3^4 - 1)/2 = 40$ values—the numbers 1:40. So we’ll concentrate on just
expressing these nonnegative integers.

To modify the unsigned trinary conversion to a signed one, we use the
observation that

- The equation `x/3 = d rem 2` is equivalent to the equation `x/3 = (d+1) rem -1`.

This is a bit of an abuse of the notation; but here’s an example of what
we are trying to say. We know that

- `8/3 = 2 rem 2`, which is the same as saying `8 = 2*3 + 2`.

Another way of writing this is

- `8 = (2+1)*3 - 1 = 3*3 - 1` which we’ll write as: `8/3 = 3 rem -1`

So (when considering only nonnegative $x$) the pseudo-code for the
algorithm becomes:

```text
i = 0  # assume indexing starts at 0
r = zeros(m)
maxval = (3^m - 1)/2
if x > maxval then throw("x is out of range")

while x > 0
  d = floor(x/3)
  r[i] = x mod 3
  if r[i]==2
    d = d+1
    r[i] = -1
  x = d
  i = i+1
  
return r  # we won't reverse it, to be consistent with our puzzle solution
```

Let’s convert 18 to signed trinary.

```
18/3 = 6 rem 0
6/3 = 2 rem 0
2/3 = 0 rem 2 = 1 rem -1
1/3 = 0 rem 1
```

So 18 = \[0 0 -1 1\] = `(0*1) + (0*3) + (-1*9) + (1*27)`. In the scale
notation that we used while solving the puzzle, we would write this as
$[\{27\} | \{x, 9\}]$, meaning the 27-weight is in the left pan, and the
9-weight is in the right pan with $x$.

Here’s the code.

``` r
# convert nonnegative x to signed trinary
weigh = function(x) {
  if(x > 40) stop("x out of range")
  r = numeric(4)
  i = 1
  while(x > 0) {
    d = floor(x/3)
    r[i] = x %% 3
    if(r[i]==2) {
      d = d+1
      r[i] = -1
    }
    x = d
    i = i+1
  }
  r
}

# write the signed trinary representation in our scale notation
scale_notation = function(signs) {
  w = c(1, 3, 9, 27)
  lefti = which(signs > 0)
  righti = which(signs < 0)
  
  leftset = paste(w[lefti], collapse=", ")
  if(length(righti) > 0)
    rightset = paste("x,", paste(w[righti], collapse=", "))
  else
    rightset = "x"
  
  notation = paste("[ {", leftset, "} | {", rightset, "} ]")
  notation
}

# convert signed trinary back to decimal
to_x = function(signs) {
   w = c(1, 3, 9, 27)
   x = sum(w*signs) # dot product of w and signs
}
```

Let’s try a few.

``` r
x = 18
signs = weigh(x)
# convert back and check it's the same number
stopifnot(x == to_x(signs))
scale_notation(signs)
```

    ## [1] "[ { 27 } | { x, 9 } ]"

``` r
x = 35
signs = weigh(x)
stopifnot(x == to_x(signs))
scale_notation(signs)
```

    ## [1] "[ { 9, 27 } | { x, 1 } ]"

``` r
x = 15
signs = weigh(x)
stopifnot(x == to_x(signs))
scale_notation(signs)
```

    ## [1] "[ { 27 } | { x, 3, 9 } ]"

``` r
x = 30
signs = weigh(x)
stopifnot(x == to_x(signs))
scale_notation(signs)
```

    ## [1] "[ { 3, 27 } | { x } ]"

``` r
x = 4
signs = weigh(x)
stopifnot(x == to_x(signs))
scale_notation(signs)
```

    ## [1] "[ { 1, 3 } | { x } ]"

So now we can weigh objects we know the weight of. Hurrah? But I still
think it’s cute.
