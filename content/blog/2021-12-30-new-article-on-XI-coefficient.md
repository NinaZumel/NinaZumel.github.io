I have a [new article](https://win-vector.com/2021/12/29/exploring-the-xi-correlation-coefficient/) up on the Win-Vector blog, about the &xi; ('XI') correlation coeffient that was recently introduced by Professor Sourav Chatterjee in his paper, [“A New Coefficient of Correlation”](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10140).

Unlike traditional correlation coefficients, &xi; does not assume that the relationship between *x* and *y* is linear; in principle, it can be any functional relationship. While this is potentially useful, &xi; also has some disadvantages, too. 

In my [Win-Vector post](https://win-vector.com/2021/12/29/exploring-the-xi-correlation-coefficient/), I run some informal experiments to try to get a sense of what different values of ξ might mean.

Please check it out.
