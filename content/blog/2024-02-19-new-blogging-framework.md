My jekyll-generated website (served by Github Pages) failed to build a couple of weeks ago; I don't know why. I'm not enough of a front-end developer to diagnose the problem. After looking around for an updated template to move to, I eventually decided to give the [Eleventy static site generator](https://www.11ty.dev/) a try.

So this is my new site, based on Eleventy's [official starter blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) template. It wasn't too hard to figure out, and deployed surprisingly easily! Best of all, Eleventy is built to be [stable](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/stability/); which hopefully means I won't run into that *my website won't build, and I don't know why!* problem again.[^1] Hurray!

A better developer than I am probably could have migrated the old jekyll site completely, but I didn't manage to do that. I've only carried a few blog posts and pages over for the moment. I'll put a few more of the old posts back, and my publications page; eventually I'll figure out how to get my bookshelf and my talks pages back up, too. But at least there's something here, for now.
