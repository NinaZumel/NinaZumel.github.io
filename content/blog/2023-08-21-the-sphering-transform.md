I have a new blog post up on the Win Vector blog: [Detecting Data Differences Using the Sphering Transform](https://win-vector.com/2023/08/20/detecting-data-differences-using-the-sphering-transform/). 

{% image "./images/new_raw_comp_xformed.png", "Distributions of sphered norms for two data sets with different distributions", [200, 400, 800, "auto"] %}

In this post, I discuss how to convert the problem of detecting changes in multivariate distributions to the simpler problem of detecting changes in univariate distributions. Please check it out.
