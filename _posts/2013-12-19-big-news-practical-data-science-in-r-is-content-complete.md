<p>It's been a while since I've posted here, but I have good news: the last appendix has gone to the editors. The book is now content complete. What a relief!</p>
<p>We are hoping to release the book late in the first quarter of next year. In the meantime, you can still get early drafts of our chapters through Manning’s Early Access program, if you haven’t yet. The link is <a href="http://www.manning.com/zumel/">here</a>.</p>

<p>We look forward to sharing the final version of the book with you next year.</p>
