Back in the good old days, *ninazumel.com* was a static site that I maintained myself, in pure HTML. But that (to me) was so much of a hassle that I never did even the little bit of site maintenance that the website required. So I moved it to wordpress.com. 

At that point, I already had [*Multo*](https://multoghost.wordpress.com/) for personal blogging, and did my technical writing on the [Win-Vector blog](https://winvector.com/blog-2). I didn't need another blog, but since the Wordpress site had one, I did it for a while. But the frequency of my posts (never high) has fallen off quite a bit in the last few years, which makes the site look particularly moribund. Frankly, Wordpress is overkill for my needs.

So here I am, back to a static site, this time on Github Pages. This is a good compromise for me: the site is clean and simple to maintain, without demanding that I constantly add new content. Perfect.

I did bring over some of the blog posts from the Wordpress site, especially some of the essays I wrote early on, which I still like and am proud on. Also a few posts that document the progress of *Practical Data Science with R* (both editions), for sentimental reasons.  I invite you to browse, if you feel like it.

I may still sometimes post a new article, but it will be infrequently. Look for me on the Win-Vector blog and on *Multo*. Cheers!
