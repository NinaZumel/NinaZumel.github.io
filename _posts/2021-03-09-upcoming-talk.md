John Mount and I will be giving a talk for the online University of San Francisco Seminar Series in Data Science:

**How and Why to Use Probability Models to Outperform Decision Rules**<br>
Friday, April 30, 2021 <br>
12:30pm - 2pm Pacific Time<br>
[See here for full details and to RSVP](https://www.meetup.com/USF-Seminar-Series-in-Data-Science/events/276764072/)

This talk will argue that working with probabilities is preferable to directly fitting hard classifiers for classification problems. We will show how to work with probabilities, and demonstrate effective methods to evaluate and present probability models. We will also present a nice system for later picking decision thresholds that maximize business utility.

We will share example code and data in Python.

Hope to see you there!
