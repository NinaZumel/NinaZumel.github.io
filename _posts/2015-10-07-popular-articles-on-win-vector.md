<blockquote><p>As readers have surely noticed the Win-Vector LLC blog isnâ€™t a stream of short notes, but instead a collection of long technical articles. It is the only way we can properly treat topics of consequence.</p>
<p>What not everybody may have noticed is a number of these articles are serialized into series for deeper comprehension. </p></blockquote>

<p>Our series include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.win-vector.com/blog/category/statistics-to-english-translation/">Statistics to English Translation</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.win-vector.com/blog/tag/statistics-as-it-should-be/">Statistics as It Should Be</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.win-vector.com/blog/tag/r-as-it-is/">R as It Is</a></li>
</ul>
