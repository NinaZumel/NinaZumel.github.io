I have a new blog post up on the Win Vector blog: [Detecting Data Differences Using the Sphering Transform](https://win-vector.com/2023/08/20/detecting-data-differences-using-the-sphering-transform/). 

<p><img style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/posts/new_raw_comp_xformed.png" alt="Distributions of sphered norms for two data sets with different distributions" border="0" /></p>

In this post, I discuss how to convert the problem of detecting changes in multivariate distributions to the simpler problem of detecting changes in univariate distributions. Please check it out.
