I want to check what code blocks look like natively in this blog theme.

```R
library(ggplot2, quietly=TRUE) 
  # try to shut the messages up

df = data.frame(y = rnorm(100))

ggplot(df, aes(x=y)) + 
  geom_density(adjust=0.5) +
  ggtitle("A plot")

```

Pretty awful without the code marker, apparently. Will a code marker make it better?

Also, I may have to add times to the posts, if I want to do more than one in a day.
