In your mainline narrative text, create a link to the footnote using the following syntax:

... mainline narrative text to footnote<sup id="a1">[Note 1](#f1)</sup> 

You can put whatever you like inside the square brackets []; I've chosen Note 1 only because that suits me. The important thing to note here is that we're just creating a markdown anchor, and using a tiny bit of html to render it as a superscript.

Create the footnote using the following syntax:

----

<b id="f1">Note 1</b> ... text of footnote here ... [â†©](#a1)
