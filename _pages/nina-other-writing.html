<p>In addition to the peer-reviewed papers listed under<a title="Publications" href="https://ninazumel.wordpress.com/publications/"> Publications</a>, I also have written or collaborated on other articles and essays about a variety of topics, both technical and non-technical.</p>
<h2>Technical Articles</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.win-vector.com/blog/" rel="self"><strong>The Win-Vector Blog</strong></a><br />
Articles approximately once a month on topics in math, statistics, computation, and anything else we think is interesting. Co-authored with John Mount.</p>
<p><a href="http://winvector.github.io/DataPrep/EN-CNTNT-Whitepaper-Data-Prep-Using-R.pdf"><strong>Preparing data for analysis using R</strong></a><br />
A white paper on data exploration and treatment in R, including a survey of commonly encountered data issues and how to resolve them. I also briefly introduce <a href="https://github.com/WinVector/vtreat"><code>vtreat</code></a>, Win-Vector's R package for automated data treatment (<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vtreat/index.html">CRAN distribution</a>). This paper was generously sponsored by Microsoft Data Science.</p>
<p><strong>Articles that I've authored or contributed to that haven't been formally published.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.mzlabs.com/NinaZumel/publications/ImprovWhitePaper.pdf"><strong>Comparing Apples And Oranges:</strong></a> A paper with John Mount on the limits of statistical inference in the Google AdSense market.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mzlabs.com/NinaZumel/publications/ImprovWhitePaper.pdf"><strong>"Something out of Something": Improvisational Training for Emergency Managers:</strong></a> A white paper about improvisation, in the context of emergency management.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09477"><strong>vtreat: a data.frame Processor for Predictive Modeling:</strong></a> Describes the theory of data preparation behind <code>vtreat</code>, and demonstrates its use.</p>
<h2>Nontechnical Writing</h2>
<p><strong><a href="http://multoghost.wordpress.com/">Multo (Ghost)</a></strong>: a blog on things ghostly: reviews of supernatural and weird fiction, essays about folklore and history, and random musings.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://exiw.wordpress.com">Ephemera</a></strong>:  a playground for my (very occasional) forays into fiction, personal essay, or any writing that won’t fit my other blogs. </p>
<p>Folklore articles I’ve written for the <a href="http://folklorethursday.com/author/nina/"><strong>#FolkloreThursday</strong></a> blog.  </p>
<p><a href="https://exiw.wordpress.com/tag/punjab/"><strong>Some articles originally written for the Non Stop Bhangra and Dholrhythms blogs</strong></a>: pieces about Punjabi music, culture and folklore, especially as they relate to Dholrhythms Dance Company and San Francisco's Non Stop Bhangra monthly party. </p>
<p>Book reviews I've published at <a href="http://mantlethought.org/content/nina-zumel"><strong>The Mantle</strong></a>.</p>
