<p><strong><a href="http://multoghost.wordpress.com/">Multo (Ghost)</a></strong>: a blog on things ghostly: reviews of supernatural and weird fiction, essays about folklore and history, and random musings.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://exiw.wordpress.com">Ephemera</a></strong>:  a playground for my forays into translation, fiction, personal essay, or any writing that won’t fit my other blogs. </p>

[**Some Ongoing Translation Series**](https://exiw.wordpress.com/translations/): When I have time, I like to practice translating public domain short stories of the supernatural and the macabre by Spanish language authors that I'm interested in. 

<p>Folklore articles I’ve written for the <a href="http://folklorethursday.com/author/nina/"><strong>#FolkloreThursday</strong></a> blog.  </p>

<p><a href="https://exiw.wordpress.com/tag/punjab/"><strong>Some articles originally written for the Non Stop Bhangra and Dholrhythms blogs</strong></a>: pieces about Punjabi music, culture and folklore, especially as they relate to Dholrhythms Dance Company and San Francisco's Non Stop Bhangra monthly party. </p>

<p>Book reviews I've published at <a href="http://mantlethought.org/content/nina-zumel"><strong>The Mantle</strong></a>.</p>
