I am a Founder and Principal Consultant with [Win-Vector LLC](https://win-vector.com/), a data science consulting and training firm based in San Francisco. My technical interests include data science, statistics, statistical learning, and data visualization. I am also interested in data science training and teaching.

In addition, I am the VP of Data Science Practice for [Wallaroo.ai](https://www.wallaroo.ai/). The Wallaroo platform orchestrates the data science "last mile": deploying, managing, and monitoring ML models in production, in a data scientist-friendly manner.

With John Mount, I co-authored [<em>Practical Data Science with R</em>](https://www.manning.com/books/practical-data-science-with-r-second-edition) (now in a second edition). This book presents the process and principles of data science from a practitioner’s perspective, and complements existing texts on machine learning, statistics, and R.

When I’m not working, I [write](https://ninazumel.com/nina-other-writing/) and [dance](http://www.dholrhythms.com/).
