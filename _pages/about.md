I am a Principal Consultant with [Win-Vector LLC](http://win-vector.com/), a data science consulting and training firm based in San Francisco. My technical interests include data science, statistics, statistical learning, and data visualization. 

I am also the VP of Data Science Practice for [Wallaroo](https://www.wallaroo.ai/). The Wallaroo platform manages the data science/ML process, in particular making the transition from model development to deployment fast and seamless. 

With John Mount, I co-authored [*Practical Data Science with R*](https://www.manning.com/books/practical-data-science-with-r-second-edition) (now in a second edition). This book presents the process and principles of data science from a practitioner’s perspective, and complements existing texts on machine learning, statistics, and R.

In recent years, I have also become heavily involved with data science related training and teaching. I have developed data science and machine learning related courses and material, both publically available online courses and proprietary courses for large corporations.

My approach to teaching, training, and technical writing is an emphasis on a solid understanding of the fundamentals. I try to synthesize relevant ideas and theories from the statistics, computer science, and other research communities so that they are understandable by technical but non-specialist learners who want to apply these ideas in their own field. 

For more details, see my [CV](/cv/).

When I’m not working, I [write](https://ninazumel.com/nina-other-writing/) and [dance](http://www.dholrhythms.com/).
