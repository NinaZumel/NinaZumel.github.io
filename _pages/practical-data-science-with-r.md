John Mount and I are proud to present our book, [*Practical Data Science with R, 2nd Edition*](https://www.manning.com/books/practical-data-science-with-r-second-edition).  This is the book for you if you are a data scientist, want to be a data scientist, work with data scientists, or hire data scientists.

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://NinaZumel.github.io/files/images/zumel-pdsr-2ed-hi.jpg" width="400"/></p>

Our goal is to present data science from a pragmatic, practice-oriented viewpoint. The book will complement other analytics, statistics, machine learning, data science and R books with the following features:

* This book teaches you how to work as a data scientist. Learn how important listening, collaboration, honest presentation and iteration are to what we do.

* The key emphasis of the book is process: collecting requirements, loading data, examining data, building models, validating models, documenting and deploying models to production.

* We provide over 10 significant example datasets, and demonstrate the concepts that we discuss with fully worked exercises using standard R methods. We feel that this approach allows us to illustrate what we really want to teach and to demonstrate all the preparatory steps necessary to any real-world project.

* This book is scrupulously correct on statistics, but presents topics in the context and order a practitioner worries about them.  We emphasize machine learning and prediction over the use of summary statistics.
