This site is made with Jekyll, using a modified version of the [AcademicPages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) theme, 
which itself is based on an older version of [minimal-mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).

The Data Science gallery page is based on [gradfolio's](https://github.com/jitinnair1/gradfolio/) project gallery.
