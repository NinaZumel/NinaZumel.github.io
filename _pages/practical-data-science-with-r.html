<p>John Mount and I are proud to present our book, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.manning.com/books/practical-data-science-with-r-second-edition"><em>Practical Data Science with R, 2nd Edition</em></a>.  This is the book for you if you are a data scientist, want to be a data scientist, work with data scientists, or hire data scientists.</p>

<p>Our goal is to present data science from a pragmatic, practice-oriented viewpoint. The book will complement other analytics, statistics, machine learning, data science and R books with the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>This book teaches you how to work as a data scientist. Learn how important listening, collaboration, honest presentation and iteration are to what we do.</li>
<li>The key emphasis of the book is process: collecting requirements, loading data, examining data, building models, validating models, documenting and deploying models to production.</li>
<li>We provide over 10 significant example datasets, and demonstrate the concepts that we discuss with fully worked exercises using standard R methods. We feel that this approach allows us to illustrate what we really want to teach and to demonstrate all the preparatory steps necessary to any real-world project.</li>
<li>This book is scrupulously correct on statistics, but presents topics in the context and order a practitioner worries about them.  We emphasize machine learning and prediction over the use of summary statistics.</li>
</ul>
<p>In support of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.manning.com/books/practical-data-science-with-r-second-edition"><em>Practical Data Science with R, 2nd Edition</em></a> we are providing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Table of Contents, and a free example chapter available from the Manning book page.</li>

<li>Downloadable <a href="https://github.com/WinVector/PDSwR2/tree/master/CodeExamples">example code</a>.</li>
</ul>
