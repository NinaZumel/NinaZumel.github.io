This is a collection of "lost" supernatural and apparently supernatural tales from well-known Golden Age crime writers. I suspect it will be more interesting and enjoyable to crime fiction buffs who don't mind some spookiness on the side, than it will be to ghost story fans who aren't that into detective stories.

So I'm categorizing the collection as "Crime" rather than "Supernatural." Since I like both genres, I enjoyed the book a lot, and if you like both genres, you might like it, too.
