What a great collection this is! Written by a Malaysian author living in England, mostly about Malaysian characters (sometime in England). Full of elements of Malaysian folklore. The folklore creatures remind me a little of Filipino folklore, and the Malaysian characters and their family dynamics remind me a little of my own family.
