It's 1936. Something strange is happening in remote Cainsmarsh: too much fear, paranoia, suspicion. Too much drug use for such a rural region. What is the miasma that pervades the region?

H. G. Wells wrote this on the cusp of World War II, a tense period in world history. I can't exactly say I enjoyed the story, but when I read it in 2018, it definitely hit home for me in many ways.
