*The Necromancer* was one of the "seven horrid novels" famously discussed by two young women in Jane Austin's *Northanger Abbey*. The version the pair were referring to was a 1794 translation by Peter Will (as Peter Teuthold) of the 1792 German original.

*This* version is an earlier, 1793 translation of the first half of the novel, by 
"T. Dutton." And I found it! I don't usually go in for full blown eighteenth century Gothic romance in all its glory, but *The Necromancer* was pretty fun. And hunting down its provenance was even more fun.
