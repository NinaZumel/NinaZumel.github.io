Catherine Crowe was a fairly well-known collector of "true" supernatural phenomena. *Ghosts and Family Legends* is partly anecdotes told by friends around a fire during the Christmas season, and partly fully structured stories that I assume are fiction.

I shared one [full-structured story,](https://multoghost.wordpress.com/2016/06/21/the-italians-story/) from the second half of the book, and several allegedly true anecdotes from the first half of the book, as winter tales.
