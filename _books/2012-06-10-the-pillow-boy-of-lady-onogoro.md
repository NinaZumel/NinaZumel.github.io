The concubine of an eleventh century Japanese general hires a blind stableboy to whisper erotic stories to her while she is in bed with the general, because he doesn't quite do it for her. Believe it or not, the framing story of this novel is every bit as engrossing as the individual tales. 

Mentioned in an article listing several short story cycle style novels that I'm fond of (or was as the time).
