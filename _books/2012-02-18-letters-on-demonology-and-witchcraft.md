title: Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft
---

Written in the form of letters to Scott's son-in-law, *Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft* is both a sceptical dismissal of supernatural phenomena, and an excuse to tell good spooky stories. It's enjoyable and often informative on both levels. 

I wrote a series of posts, about various letters that comprise the book:

* [Letter 1](https://multoghost.wordpress.com/2012/02/18/letters-on-demonology-and-witchcraft-1/)
* [Letter 2](https://multoghost.wordpress.com/2012/02/19/letter-2-witchcraft-in-the-bible/)
* [Letter 3](https://multoghost.wordpress.com/2012/02/29/from-letter-3-river-gods-and-revenant-warriors/)
* [A folktale from Letter 3](https://multoghost.wordpress.com/2012/02/25/hiding-in-plain-sight/)
* [A folk saga alluded to in  Letter 3](https://multoghost.wordpress.com/2012/03/01/the-haunting-at-frodis-water/)
* [An amusing story from Letter 10](https://multoghost.wordpress.com/2012/03/07/truth-like-fiction/)
