> In many respects the American Library has become the most basic First Amendment institution. We are guards, yet we guard no less than the sum of human knowledge. We are the library police. <br/>
-- Jason Shiga, *Bookhunter*

The adventures of Agent Bay of the Oakland Library Police. Who knew that library police procedurals was a genre?

Set in 1973, but with a definite early-21st century sensibility. Kinda silly, completely fun.
