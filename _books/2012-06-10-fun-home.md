Mentioned in an article listing several short story cycle style novels that I'm fond of (or was at the time).

*Fun Home* is Alison Bechdel's memoir of her father, a closeted gay teacher and funeral director. Not so much different linked stories, as the same story or two told over and over again, from different perspectives.
