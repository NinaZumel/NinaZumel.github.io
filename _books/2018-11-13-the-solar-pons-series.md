title: The Solar Pons Series

This bookshelf entry is in honor of the entire August Derleth-authored Solar Pons series (I've not read the Basil Copper-authored Pons stories). I think it's the best Sherlock Holmes pastiche out there.

I also happen to own a copy of the Mycroft & Moran edition of *The Chronicles of Solar Pons*, which is why I chose its cover to represent the series.
