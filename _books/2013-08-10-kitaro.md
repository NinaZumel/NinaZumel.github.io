This manga about the adventures of a little *yokai* boy feels very of its time (the late 1960s), but was fun to read nonetheless.

Mizuki was clearly quite familiar not only with Japanese folklore, but with the western ghost story tradition as well, as [I show in my blog post.](https://multoghost.wordpress.com/2013/08/10/kitaro-and-the-beast-with-five-fingers/)
