*McSweeney's Quarterly 45*: An issue of a literary magazine masquerading as a book.

Contains stories of the macabre from Alfred Hitchcock's *Stories Not for the Nervous* (1965) and Ray Bradbury's *Timeless Stories fo Today and Tomorrow* (1952). Sadly, seems to be out of print. Sorry. See if you can find it (or the orginal anthologies); it's great.
