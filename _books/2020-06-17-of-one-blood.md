Originally serialized in *Colored American Magazine* around 1902, and written by that magazine's editor, Pauline Hopkins. Recounts the tale of a mixed-race doctor who sails to Africa and stumbles upon Telassar, the lost capital of ancient Ethiopia.

The novel is racial commentary, supernatural melodrama, pulp adventure, and maybe a little bit science fiction. Or utopian fiction. It's hard to say how to categorize *Of One Blood*. I finally decided on *Gothic Romance*.
