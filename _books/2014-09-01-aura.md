I remember that I picked this up because a reader from Mexico who visited my site mentioned that *Aura* was their favorite Fuentes novel. I was not disappointed.

A young scholar is hired to edit the memoirs of a deceased Mexican army general. He meets and fall in love with Aura, the general's widow's niece. But, of course, she has a secret....

Fuentes revisited some of the themes in *Aura* in his novella "Constancia," which was set in the US, and makes references more to US rather than Mexican history. Also excellent, and somewhat more accessible to me, as a US reader. But *Aura* is lovely, too.
