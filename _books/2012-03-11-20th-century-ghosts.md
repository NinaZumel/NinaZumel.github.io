The first short story collection from Joe Hill, a writer I thoroughly enjoy. This volume is a big reason why. I admire how well Hill can inhabit the mindset of the young people who populate many of his tales. 

The collection has just been re-released as [*The Black Phone*](https://www.waterstreetbooks.com/book/9780063214835), in anticipation of the upcoming movie.
