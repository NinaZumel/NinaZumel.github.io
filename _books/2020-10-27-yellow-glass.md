A collection of antiquarian and/or folklore-inspired ghost stories by British folklorist and historian Francis Young.

I picked this up for the M.R. James connection: Young and James were both born and raised in Suffolk and share some professional and personal interests. Including a taste for ghost stories. Young's tales aren't all necessarily "Jamesian," but as I wrote in my review, they are "unsettling... all enjoyable, and four [out of seven] of them are strong."
