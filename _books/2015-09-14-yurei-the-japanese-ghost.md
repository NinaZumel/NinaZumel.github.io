Zack Davisson's book about Japanese ghosts, or *yurei* is an interesting discussion of traditional Japanese belief systems and the history of the *kaidan* (ghost stories, or weird tales). Includes a great selection of representative *kaidan* as well, some previously untranslated, I think. 

I have the hardcover first edition, and it's gorgeous.
