I loved this so much. Every so often, I remember Tagore, and go find more of his short stories---there are easy to find public domain translations on Project Gutenberg, and other places. And I fall in love again.

The translations in this [Oxford Press collection](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/selected-short-stories-9780195658293?cc=us&lang=en&) are generally better than the public domain ones, or at least more modern. I had borrowed it from the library to read; I really should just buy it.
