James' collection of Old Testament apocrypha is not nearly as dry as you'd expect something like this to be. His voice is much like it is in his ghost stories. If you were raised Christian or Jewish, this is an interesting way to look at the mythology almost from "the outside" --- and if you were not raised in either of those traditions, then it's an interesting collection of legends from a different mythology.


[The post at *Multo*](https://multoghost.wordpress.com/2013/05/15/solomon-and-the-demons/) discusses the story of Solomon and the demons, from James' version.
