I never wrote a full blog post about Harvey's collection of ghost stories, even though Harvey is one of my favorite ghost story writers. He's not as well known as he should be. But I do bring up individual stories several times.

Shigeru Mizuki appropriated one of Harvey's most famous stories for *Kitaro*, [as I discuss here.](https://multoghost.wordpress.com/2013/08/10/kitaro-and-the-beast-with-five-fingers/) 

I also shared Harvey's ["Account Rendered"](https://multoghost.wordpress.com/2014/12/03/account-rendered/) as a winter tale one year, and discussed the vampire story ["Miss Avenal"](https://multoghost.wordpress.com/2020/04/21/more-living-vampires/) later on. Both these stories are from what I think of as Harvey's "Nurse Wilkie series," about the adventures of a private nurse amongst her wealthy clients. All good stuff.
