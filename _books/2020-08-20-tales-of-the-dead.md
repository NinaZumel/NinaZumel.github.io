This is an 1813 English translation of *Fantasmagoriana* (or part of it, at least), a collection of German gothic supernatural tales that is famous for being the reading material of Mary Shelley and company, the summer that Shelley wrote *Frankenstein*. 

This is probably the anthology that got me thinking more favorably about Gothic romance. Short-form gothic romance, at least.
