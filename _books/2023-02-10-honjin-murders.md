A classic locked-room mystery, set in 1937 Japan. 
This is an admiring tribute to Western Golden Age detective fiction, 
with an over-the-top, inventive solution.

The first of the series featuring private detective Kosuke Kindaichi. The English translation by Louise Heal Kawai was published in 2019.
