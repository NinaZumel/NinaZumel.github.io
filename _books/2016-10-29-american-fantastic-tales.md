This is a two-volume set collecting examples of American fantastic and supernatural literature from Poe until the first decade of the twenty-first century. My discussion was really about the second volume, which went from the 1940s to about 2010, but there wasn't a good cover image of that volume in Open Library.

Volume two is great, by the way.
