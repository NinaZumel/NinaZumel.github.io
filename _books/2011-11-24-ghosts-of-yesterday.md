Jack Cady is an author I was quite fond of, for a while. His stories are quiet and understated, at best eerie rather than scary. Thematically, he tends to treat  ghosts and hauntings as metaphors for the effect of history and the past on the present. His collections are generally an interesting read, if your tastes run in that direction.
