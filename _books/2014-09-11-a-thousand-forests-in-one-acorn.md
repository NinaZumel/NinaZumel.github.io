The original post only linked to my review of the book at *The Mantle* -- but that magazine is gone, and alas, I no longer have the review.

This is an anthology of Spanish-language literature, as translated by a variety of translators. Some are short stories; some are excerpts of novels. Much of it had never at the time been translated to English before. 

It was both fascinating and, for me, frustrating, because there were so many authors I wanted to explore whose greater body of work had not yet been (and may still not be) translated. Alas, my Spanish-language reading ability is still very slow; this is partly why I've started practicing translation on my own (on public domain short stories). So English translations would be so valuable.

At any rate, if you are at all interested in Spanish language fiction, *do* pick it up.
