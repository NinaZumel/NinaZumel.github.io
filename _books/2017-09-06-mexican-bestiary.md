*Mexican Bestiary* is an entertaining discussion of various mythical creatures from Mexican folklore, but this entry in the bookshelf is really meant to cover all the reference books that I mention in the [related post.]((https://multoghost.wordpress.com/2017/09/06/folklore-dictionaries-handbooks-and-overviews-a-very-incomplete-review/))

I've stopped writing much about folklore and legends in the past few years, but I may go back to it someday. This will be a useful list, even for me.
