> A charming, meandering book of philosophical musings disguised as a novel. <br/>
-- Me, back in 2014 or so.

The construction site of a luxury high-rise in Buenos Aires is haunted, but only the Chilean immigrant laborers working on the site---and their families---can see the ghosts. Patri, the foreman's teenaged daughter, gets especially involved with these otherworldly beings.

I started *Ghosts* expecting a regular ghost story, so it took a while to get into the novella's rhythm. But I did, and it was worth it.
