*The Cyberiad* is a delightful collection of short stories about the constructor robots Trurl and Klapaucius as they travel the galaxy, and I know you all want me to classify it as *science fiction*. But it's not. I really want to classify it as *fairy tales*, but I'm going to compromise and call it *fantasy*, instead. 

The stories are not just fun, they're quite mathematically sophisticated, too, as I discuss in [my post at *ninazumel.com*](https://ninazumel.com/2013/07/11/dragons-of-probability/).
