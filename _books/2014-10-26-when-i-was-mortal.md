One of two Mar√≠as short story collections that I read while on my Spanish literature kick. I've never read his novels, but I love his short stories.
They have, variously, supernatural, ghosts, crime, and the macabre.

For the moment I've classified them as *magical realism*, though I don't think he'd consider himself a practitioner of that genre. But it will do, for now.
