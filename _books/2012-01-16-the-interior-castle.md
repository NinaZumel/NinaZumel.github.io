Quoted in a little quote/photocollage post that I once wrote. 

I've always liked Teresa of Avila's metaphor of the soul as a castle, and the journey through the rooms of the castle on one's spiritual journey. It's also humbling to realize that one has probably never penetrated beyond the first chamber, if even that far.
