*Peregrinaggio di tre giovani figliuoli del re di Serendippo* (The Peregrinations of the three young sons of the King of Serendippo) is a sixteenth century collection of fantastical tales in a framing story, rather like *1001 Nights* (but not so elaborate).

*Serendipity and the Three Princes* is an English translation of the *Peregrinaggio*, with commentary, published in 1965. I managed to pick up a copy, but I think it is also available to borrow from the Open Library. It's quite interesting.

I retold a few stories from the *Pereginaggio* on the blog.
