A *huge* collection of representative stories of The Weird, as defined by the VanderMeers. Fascinating reading. 

I never reviewed it, but I mention stories from the anthology several times:

* [This post is about science fiction](https://multoghost.wordpress.com/2012/10/17/a-different-kind-of-science-fiction/)
* [On Hagiwara Sakutaro's 1935 short story, "The Town of Cats"](https://multoghost.wordpress.com/2012/09/14/town-of-cats/)
* [On Georg Heym's "The Dissection* (1913)](https://multoghost.wordpress.com/2012/08/18/imagery-in-translation-georg-heyms-the-dissection/)
