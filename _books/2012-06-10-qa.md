The novel that became the film *Slumdog Millionaire*. A poor tiffin seller must defend himself against charges that he cheated to win a TV quiz show. A bit different from the movie; both are good. 

Mentioned in an article listing several short story cycle style novels that I'm fond of (or was at the time).
