*The Inn at the Spessart* was one of three collections of *märchen* written by nineteenth century poet and Romantic Wilhelm Hauff. The version 
I read was from *Tales of Wilhelm Hauff*, as translated by S. Mendel in 1886. This is one of the earliest 
complete collections of Hauff's *märchen* in English, and it's charming.

All of the individual stories are wonderful, and the fairy-tale-like framing story is charming, too. Includes one 
of Hauff's most famous tales, "The Cold Heart" (Das Kalte Herz).
