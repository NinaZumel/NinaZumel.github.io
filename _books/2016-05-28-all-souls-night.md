I know I said that I never write about a book I don't like, and I don't dislike *All Souls' Night*. But I say in my post that I had put the book aside; nearly seven years later, I still haven't picked it up again.

Maybe the stories won't bring me down now the way they did at the time, but I've never wanted to take a chance.
