This was my first conscious introduction to the anthologies of Ellen Datlow -- I'd previously read *Supernatural Noir*, without taking note that she was the editor. A collection of nontraditional ghost stories, often told in a "literary" style that only touches on the supernatural.

By and large, they are not scary. But I don't mind that.
